Test whether two vectors are exactly equal (element by element).
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,]))

Ans:vec1==vec2

2. Sort the character vector in ascending order and descending order.
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,]))

Ans: 
sort(vec1)
sort(vec1,decreasing = TRUE)
sort(vec2)
sort(vec1,decreasing = TRUE)

3. What is the major difference between str() and paste() show an example.

Ans: str(): str function is used to compactly display the internal structure of an R object. Ideally only one line for each basic structure is displayed.

e.g. str(mtcars) will show one line for each variable, and display its data along with some values

paste(): It is used to concatenate vectors after converting to character.

e.g.:(paste(x, sep = "",collapse = "-"))

It will concatenate all values of x vector and use "-" as sepertor between the values

4. Introduce a separator when concatenating the strings.

Ans: Collapse function within Paste function concatenate string with a seperator
