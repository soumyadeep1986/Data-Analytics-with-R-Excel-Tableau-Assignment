Create a box and whisker plot by class using mtcars dataset.

Ans:- boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars, xlab = "Number of Cylinders",
        ylab = "Miles Per Gallon", main = "Mileage Data")

     boxplot(mtcars$mpg ~ factor(mtcars$vs), main = "Boxplot of Miles/Gallon for Different Engine Types")
