 1. If Z is norm (mean = 0, sd = 1)
Find P(Z > 2.64)
Find P(|Z| > 1.39)

Ans: > pnorm(2.64, lower.tail=FALSE)
[1] 0.004145301
 
> pnorm(1.39, lower.tail=FALSE)
[1] 0.08226444

2. Suppose p = the proportion of students who are admitted to the graduate school of the University of California at Berkeley, and suppose that a public relation officer boasts that UCB has historically had a 40% acceptance rate for its graduate school. Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from 1973. Assuming these observations constituted a simple random sample, are they consistent with the officerâ..s claim, or do they provide evidence that the acceptance rate was significantly less than 40%?
