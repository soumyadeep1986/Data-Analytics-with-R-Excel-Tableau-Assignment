1. Import the Titanic Dataset from the link Titanic Data Set.
Perform the following:
a. Preprocess the passenger names to come up with a list of titles that represent families
and represent using appropriate visualization graph.

Ans:

train$Name<-as.character(train$Name)

train$familysize<-train$SibSp+train$Parch+1

train$surname<-sapply(train$Name,FUN=function(x){strsplit(x,split='[,.]')[[1]][1]})

train$familyID<-paste(as.character(train$familysize),train$surname,sep="")

train$familyID[train$familysize<=2]<-'small'

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = train, aes(x = train$familyID, y = train$familysize, fill =Sex )) + 
  geom_bar(stat="Identity")

b. Represent the proportion of people survived from the family size using a graph.

Ans:plot(train$familysize,train$Survived)

c. Impute the missing values in Age variable using Mice Library, create two different
graphs showing Age distribution before and after imputation.

Ans:- Before Imputation: 
boxplot(train$Age)

After Imputation:
library("mice")
mice(tarin)
boxplot(train$Age)
