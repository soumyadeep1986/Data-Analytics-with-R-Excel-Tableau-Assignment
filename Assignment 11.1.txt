Questions

1.Say True or False for the below statements:
• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes? 
Ans: False
• Base R packages installed automatically? 
Ans:True


2.What is Recycling of elements in a vector? 

Ans: If two vectors are of unequal length then shorter one will be recyled in order to match the longer one.

3.Give an example of recycling of elements. 

Ans: Suppose the following vectors a and b of different lengths, and to calculate the sum of it, vector a value will be recycle:
> a<-c(1,2,3)
> b<-c(5,6,7,8,9)
> a+b
[1]  6  8 10  9 11
Warning message:
In a + b : longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

We can see in above example R automatically recyled or repeats the value of Shorter vector a until it is long enough to match the longer one
